README(analysis)
1) MedInc is the most important feature in the dataset.
2) Nope the results were same for this model with both with and without feature scaling.
3) Removig the less important features did not improve the model performance by ,uch just a slight change.
4) It is because the less important features did not include/added much noise, but if they would have added a lot of outliers and noise it would have been effective.
